1. **What did we do?**

     We created an algorithm that gave very detailed instructions on how to prepare a jam sandwich.

1. **What did you learn?**

     I learned that instructions on algorithms always have to be as detailed as possible for the computer to do them.

1. **What questions do I have?**

     I'd like to knows how to do a circle.

1. **What did we do?**

     We coded in python and experimented with shapes, colors, lines etc.

1. **What did you learn?**

     I learned that there's many small details that you have to be careful with when coding otherwise what you want to achieve at the        end will either be completely changed or won't appear at all due to a coding error.

1. **What questions do I have?**

     What is the difference between different coding languages such as java or python and what are their different purposes?

  1. **What did we do?**
  
       We learned in python how to make a dice that shows numbers from one to six randomely each time we click it. Then, we made a game        where there was one number from the dice that appeared more than the others, switched each other's laptops, and each team had to        guess which number appeared more often on the dice and if you guessed right before the other teams, you won a prize.
  
  1. **What did you learn?**
  
       I learned that when coding, at least in python, you use a lot of shortened up terms that each mean something very specific. For          example, "def" is short for "define". It's a keyword that you need in order to define a function. All the code that you put              between the def function_name(parameters) and end will be executed every time you call the function_name later.

1. **What questions do I have?**

     Why do we have to use coding languages such as Python or Java in order to give a computer instructions? Does a computer only            understand binary?
